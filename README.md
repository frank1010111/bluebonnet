# bluebonnet

Scaling solutions for production analysis from unconventional oil and gas wells

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install bluebonnet
```

## Usage

`bluebonnet` has a collection of tools for performing reservoir simulation in tight oil and shale gas reservoirs. The main tools are:
1. `fluids` for modeling PVT and viscosity of oil, water, and gas;
2. `flow` for building physics-based production curves; and
3. `forecast` for fitting and forecasting unconventional production.

Examples can be found inside the docs folder.
