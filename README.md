## Installation

Run the command

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/frank1010111/bluebonnet.git
```

## Usage

`bluebonnet` has a collection of tools for performing reservoir simulation in
tight oil and shale gas reservoirs. The main tools are:

1. `fluids` for modeling PVT and viscosity of oil, water, and gas;
2. `flow` for building physics-based production curves; and
3. `forecast` for fitting and forecasting unconventional production.

Examples can be found in
[the documentation](https://bluebonnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow.html).

`bluebonnet` was created by Frank Male. It is licensed under the terms of the

## Credits

This work was funded in part by an ExxonMobil grant to the University of Texas
at Austin, with Michael Marder as PI and Larry Lake as co-PI. The Physics-based
scaling curve was developed for shale gas reservoirs by Patzek et al. (2013). It
was extended to tight oil by Male (2019). It was extended to two-phase by Ruiz
Maraggi et al. (2020). It was extended to include variable fracture face
pressure by Ruiz Maraggi et al. (2021). In the future, it might be extended
further.  
`bluebonnet` was created with
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the
`py-pkgs-cookiecutter`
[template](https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter).
